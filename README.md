# Idyll Template

This is a React app that mimics the [basic template project that Idyll provides](https://idyll-lang.org/docs/getting-started).  The main differences are that their project requires a global install of Idyll to compile the Idyll markdown and doesn't have much in the way of linting or babel polyfills.

### Installation

```shell
> git clone ssh://git@stash.ihme.washington.edu:7999/viz/idyll-template.git
> npm i
> npm run build:watch
```
The Idyll data story that loads from the `build:watch` script documents how to load data and create a few basic charts
